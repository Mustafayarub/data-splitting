# data-splitting-
Data splitting involves dividing a dataset into separate subsets—usually training, validation, and test sets—to ensure that a machine learning model can be effectively trained, tuned, and evaluated. The training set helps the model learn, the validation set fine-tunes parameters, and the test set assesses its final performance.
